0.6.2

This release includes small but necessary improvements to the user interface: 

- The "Save" button will now show a "loading" indication and will prevent you from saving the same leftovers multiple times.
- Fix the UI when an item has no photo.

Also this release changes how some things work under the hood, in particular the installable web-app.

0.6.1

This is the first packaged version. There are no changes in the app itself.
