# Leftovers

*Leftovers* is a [Dropserver](https://dropserver.org) app that helps you keep track of leftover food and perishables in your refrigerator and freezer.

See the [Leftovers app website](https://leftovers.olivierforget.net/).

As a Dropserver app Leftovers does not need to "pay for itself". It can just *be*, with a lean set of features, no tracking, and no external hosting dependencies.

## Code

The backend is a [Dropserver app](https://dropserver.org/docs/building-dropserver-app).

The frontend is Vue 3 with Pinia built by Vite. It depends on Tailwind for now, but I want to go back to vanilla CSS.
